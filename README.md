# Taking a look at Food Production and GDP

In this analysis, we explore the relationship between food production and GDP by asking: 

    'Is there a relationship?' and 'What does it look like?'

To answer these overarching questions, we take a deeper look into our datasets by analyzing these components of the South Asia region: 

    - Population
    - Food Production
    - Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
    - GDP per Capita
